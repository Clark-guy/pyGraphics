#PyGraphics

## experimenting with the graphics.py library

graphics.py is a library made by John Zelle, and it is a simple implementation
of graphics using the tkinter library for python. I'm mostly using it to
explore basic principles of graphics and some basic linear algebra, and to make
cool artistic things for fun.


## How to run

run main.py in a terminal. the menu is currently terminal based but I plan to
add a tkinter gui in the near future







TODO
replace terminal UI with tkinter UI (or sfml in C? make it easier
to download)

find out how to UNdraw points (needed for cube spin, maybe
try a simpler translation first?)

input validation- for dotcube, maybe others

working items:
 * flying carpets (could stand to avoid carpet collisions)
 * random hill tops
 * random circles
 * dotcube 

non-working items worth fixing:
 * snowflake
 * circle draw (very close, just make sure dots only go a small amount)
 * fib (find something fib to do)
 * random shape (need to make strongly vertical lines work better)

items to remove or heavily refactor:
 * cube spin
 * cartToPolarTest
